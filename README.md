#Parcel tracker cli

This is an unofficial python tool for accessing [Parcelsapp.com](https://parcelsapp.com) API from command line.
It takes a universal parcel tracking number as an argument, makes a request and displays the results.

This script is written for python3 and depends on the _requests_ library.

**Usage:** `ptracker.py <tracking_number>`
